Mars Weight Solution
There are three key stages to solving this problem:

Getting the Earthling's weight from them, which we need the input function for.

Converting the Earthing's weight from a string to a number so we can do math with it. We use the float function to do this, since the weight isn't necessarily a whole number

Calculating the weight on Mars, which we do by multiplying the Earth weight by 0.378. To make the program easy to read, we store this number in a constant called MARS_MULTIPLE.
